          SMALL SCHOOLS. BIG IDEAS.
        </div>
        <div class="about_text">
          <p><strong>We want to prove that small schools can do big things. </strong></p>
          <p>We’re a team of student organizers from Philly’s three best liberal arts colleges - Swarthmore, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr. For the first time, we’re bringing together 100 new and experienced hackers for a weekend of hacking. </p>
          <p>Our goal is an inclusive space for people of all backgrounds and majors to work on amazing projects for a weekend. Seasoned hackers in top CS programs will mentor novice hackers as they team up to create web, mobile, and hardware projects from the ground-up. In bringing students together right before the presidential election, Hack the TriCo will also be an avenue to encourage civic engagement through tech. A series of workshops throughout the weekend will help hackers learn to use specific platforms and get started on their projects. </p>
          <p>The liberal arts are often overlooked in the tech world. Hack the TriCo will give liberal arts students the chance to combine our technical expertise with our creativity, analytical skills, and interdisciplinary thinking. At Hack the TriCo, small schools will bring big ideas to the table. </p>

            <div class="faq_answer">
              A hackathon is an event where students come together and dedicate themselves to a project for a weekend with a team of friends or strangers. You bring your ideas. We supply the hardware, the software, the coffee, the food and mentorship needed to make your ideas a reality.

              Hack the TriCo will begin officially on Saturday, November 5 with the welcome ceremony. A detailed schedule of events and locations throughout the weekend will be posted. All work eligible for prizes will be completed between Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. We will be taking a break between midnight and 8 AM on Sunday. Under the honor code, we expect that participants will not hack during this time. We will be holding workshops beginning the afternoon of Friday, November 4. The schedule and sign ups for workshops will be posted at a later date.

            <div class="faq_answer">
              Because Hack the TriCo is only open to students of the tri-college consortium, attendees will be expected to use college sponsored travel between the three schools. We are presently trying to schedule buses and/or vans specific to the event, so that students will not need to worry about staying on the Blue Bus or Swat Van schedule.

            <div class="faq_answer">
              All are welcome. We do not require that you have ever participated in a hackathon or even coded, previously. We are simply looking for creative and innovative people with a set of skills which they can contribute to making something.

            </div>
            <div class="faq_answer">
              Hackathons are not about winning. They are a learning experience, one that involves making friends and lots of coffee. But yes, there will be prizes on offer. A panel of judges will select the *best* hacks based upon a series of to be announced criteria. Specific prizes will be announced at a later date.
